## WoAPI

_This was initially made as a quick tool desgined to run through a VPN, hence no auth is programmed into it. You should NOT run this in production unless you consider the appropiate security measures._

Express based API server for managing wordops commands without running them via SSH. This connects to a private UI which I'll be open sourcing later on.
